    <h3>The Summer I Learned SQL Well</h3>

    <p>This was such an educational and fun summer, where I underwent a hybridized role in Health Information Management(HIM) and SQL development for QA. The company is called Intelligent Medical Objects(IMO), and they are essentially the "Intel Inside"
        when it comes to the terminology middleware used by the most prominent Electronic Health Record developers such as Epic and Cerner. So in addition to CS students, we got many Linguistics and Health/Life Sciences students in this internship joining
        the Ops team to sort out vocabulary given to us by numerous clients. Moreoever, I got a chance to mentor someone who is now going to med school because of our collaboration. And get well fed for 3 weeks by the company (one of which was Oreo week).
    </p>

    <p>Through this internship that extended into the academic year, I was able to do quality assurance work for our HIM professionals that ensures IMO remains
        <b><a href="https://www.e-imo.com/news/intelligent-medical-objects-imo-announces-growth-investment-warburg-pincus" target="_blank"> the most widely accepted medical terminology solution worldwide</a></b>. This work mostly consisted of ad-hoc SQL
        reports based on business requirements to ensure adherence to HIM editorial policies and other SQL procedures as necessary to ensure our content stays current. I was also able to develop a UI in our Confluence Wiki to show data gathered from SQL
        stored procedures so that our terminology leads could examine and improve team productivity.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you Blake, Shelly, Jane, Theresa, Katherine, John, Dr. Frank, and everyone else at IMO for taking me in when I was an unknown commodity in this industry. You have helped me grow in this field and for that I am grateful. I am a musical man and
        below is a song for you.
    </p>

    <h3>Lilo and Rosie</h3>

    <p>
        I think this song reflects how I feel very well, as quoted per the YouTube video description (yes the smiley face was in the description verbatim):

        <blockquote>
            <p><i>Lilo the Siberian husky is a wonderful surrogate to our new foster [kitten], little Rosie. Rosie was really lethargic and unresponsive after the first night. So we decided to let her cuddle extensively with Lilo (the husky). Lilo has always had
            an innate motherly instinct, but she really surprised us when she went full surrogate mode! Even letting Rosie suckle on her and stimulating her to eliminate! Lilo has never had puppies of her own, and never will. But motherhood may just be
            her calling :)</i></p>
        </blockquote>

        <b>Update:</b>
        <i>I found out that UMG has blocked the embedded video from playing on Heroku, so you'll have to play it on the YouTube site proper.  
            Click the embedded video below for further instructions.  My sentiments still stand and the song is fitting.
