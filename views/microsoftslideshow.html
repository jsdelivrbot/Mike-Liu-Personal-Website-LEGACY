    <h3>Seriously, unless you have already committed to another intern/full-time offer in writing, if even merely given the chance to interview onsite just do it to take in the environment!
    </h3>

    <p>I thought I'd just interview gracefully, have fun on Microsoft's dime, and be humored over a weekend onsite. Never did I think I had a chance to land THIS internship! I knew I had to seize this opportunity when I heard I got a chance to intern with
        the company that aspires to "empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more". I learned so much this summer and crossed so many things off my bucket list. Web API's don't seem so scary when you know how to manipulate
        the resource endpoint. It has opened my eyes to new possibilities I could not have imagined before in my career journey.
    </p>

    <p>This summer, I worked with the Windows Servicing and Delivery team that own the <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/update-compliance-using" target="_blank">Update Compliance (UC)</a></b> solution on the Operations
        Management Suite (OMS) platform to ensure that business organizations are on schedule to get the latest and greatest of Windows 10. During this internship, I worked on integrating Active Directory data into a device telemetry stream. At first,
        I didn't see the connection between the two, but then I was able to grasp identifying devices in organizational context allows for better planning around business deadlines and optimized update deployment schedules. So I wrote a proof-of-concept
        web service to do just that, and the enriched experience as demoed was well received during our all-hands meeting. Secondly, it was really intellectually challenging migrating the UC solution to accomodate a new big database query language by
        documenting best practices in the TypeScript as I examined what new data structures need parsing and how could the new query syntax be constructed. It is amazing to me that effective October 2017 some of the code I wrote will be part of helping
        build on the hard work of the team to provide accurate assessment of update deployement outcomes for the Windows 10 experience.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you to Maggie Bott, the WSD team (that I interned for including Ranjith, Ramesh, Hari, Canek and Anil who worked most directly with me), and the internship/recuirtment coordination team for everything, a truly unforgettable summer.

    <p>And to commemorate the many engineering "pearls" Microsoft has given me, here is lovely song called "Pearls of Joy" by <b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pearls-of-Joy/dp/B000QQ65KC" target="_blank">Kevin Kern</a></b>. Just click the <b>PLAY</b> button
