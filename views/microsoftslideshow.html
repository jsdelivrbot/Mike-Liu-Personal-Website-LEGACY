    <h3>Seriously, unless you have already committed to another intern/full-time offer in writing, if just given the chance to interview here just do it to take in the environment!
    </h3>

    <p>I literally jumped at this opportunity when I heard I got a chance to intern with the company that aspires to "empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more". I learned so much this summer and crossed so many things off
        my bucket list. Web API's don't seem so scary when you know how to manipulate the resource endpoint. It has opened my eyes to new possibilities I could not have imagined before in my career journey.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you to Maggie Bott, the WSD team (that I interned for), and the internship/recuirtment coordination team for everything, a truly unforgettable summer.
    </p>
